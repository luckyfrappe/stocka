# Stocka — A Modern Fashion Marketplace

Stocka is a modern fashion marketplace exploring alternative ways to engage with fashion.  
The platform combines **buying new**, **renting**, **buying pre-owned**, and **rental buyouts** into a single, thoughtful shopping experience focused on flexibility, longevity, and reduced waste.

Rather than treating fashion as strictly disposable or permanent, Stocka allows customers to choose how they want to engage with each item — whether that means owning it outright, using it temporarily, or keeping it after a rental period.

This project is built as an educational study project, demonstrating how a traditional e-commerce flow can be extended to support rental economies, circular fashion models, and sustainable design principles.

## Agile Development Process

This project follows an Agile-inspired workflow using **GitHub Projects**.  
User stories, tasks, and bugs were tracked on a Kanban board with columns for **Backlog**, **Todo**, **In progress**, and **Done**.  

Features were prioritized using a simplified **MoSCoW approach**:  
- **Must Have:** Core marketplace functionality (browse, buy, rent, buyout).  
- **Should Have:** Enhancements like search, filters, and wishlists.  
- **Could Have:** Optional UI improvements or future features.  
- **Won’t Have:** Deferred or stretch goals for later iterations.  

This setup provided clear visibility, focus on priorities, and iterative progress during development.
